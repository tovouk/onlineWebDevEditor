This is an online web development editor made with Javascript, CSS and HTML.

It has it's own section for HTML code, Javascript code, and CSS codes respectively. 

On the right side is a preview of what your code would look like as an html page.
At the top is a toggle that is labeled "Toggle" which will hide the editors from the left to allow for a full view preview.

Feel free to use this code and edit it at your leisure to build something bigger or sophisticated.

Happy coding!
